# Categories and Arrows:<br/>What Do They Do? Do They Do Things??<br/>Let's Find Out!

.footnote[A massively informal introduction to what makes arrows arrows]

---

# What is an Arrow?

In category therory, an arrow, is... well... an arrow in a diagram. Mostly.

Official definition: _stuff that maps other stuff to moar stuff_ (ie. a morphism).

...yeah, ask Arnaud or Krzysztof about that really...

---

# What is an Arrow _in Haskell_?

As is usual in Haskell, an ungodly mess of typeclasses, I'm afraid.

#### In a nutshell:

```haskell
data A x y  -- `Type -> Type -> Type` kind
```

An arrow is a computation from `x` to `y` with... some effects. And you can
compose them to build a pipeline of computations.

#### The Arrow typeclass stack:

```haskell
-- From most OK to least OK:
class Category    -- We're cool
class Arrow       -- Oh wowie! Parallel composition, still cool
class ArrowZero   -- Mostly chill
class ArrowPlus   -- Hmmm, okaaayyy...
class ArrowLoop   -- Oh, some Tardis-trickery, I can deal with it I guess...
class ArrowChoice -- Wait, we're /branching/ now? But I thought
                  -- we were making a static pipeline of...
class ArrowApply  -- PINEAPPLE! PINEAPPLE!
```

---

# Preliminary Warning

![Never use ArrowApply](https://i.imgflip.com/3hhbzp.jpg)

Rather: use monads directly. They're cool.

---

# A general form for Arrows

#### Not the _MOST_ general form, but still a general and useful one:

```haskell
newtype ArrowFromEffects f w m a b =
  ArrowFromEffects (f (w a -> m b))
```

- `f`: Applicative
- `w`: Comonad
- `m`: Monad
- `w` and `m`: Distributive (ie. `w (m a) -> m (w a)`)
- Then: `ArrowFromEffects f w m` is `Arrow`, yay

And if `f`, `w` and `m` are just `Identity`, then we just have... a pure function.

#### Decomposing that gives:

```haskell
newtype Kleisli m a b    = Kleisli (a -> m b)   -- from base
newtype Cokleisli w a b  = Cokleisli (w a -> b) -- from comonad
newtype Tannen f arr a b = Tannen (f (arr a b)) -- from bifunctors
```

Each implements all the classes up to `ArrowChoice`

---

# Composing Arrows

#### Product

```haskell
type Product arr arr' a b = (arr a b, arr' a b)
```

`arr` and `arr'` fully parallel. Cannot communicate. Implements whatever classes
`arr` and `arr'` both implement.

#### Alternation

```haskell
data Altern arr arr' a b where
  AlternId :: Altern arr arr' a a
  Altern   :: arr a x -> arr' x y -> Altern arr arr' y b -> Altern arr arr' a b
```

Can communicate. Implements at least Category and Arrow (didn't try the rest
yet. Also didn't check if it satisfies Arrow laws yet (Booooo me, yes I know))

---

# Free Arrows

Create an arrow out of a `eff :: Type -> Type -> Type` datatype which doesn't
have to implement anything:

#### Initial encoding

```haskell
data FreeArrow eff a b where
  Id    :: FreeArrow eff a a
  Arr   :: (a -> b) -> FreeArrow eff a b
  Eff   :: eff a b -> FreeArrow eff a b
  Comp  :: FreeArrow eff a b -> FreeArrow eff b c -> FreeArrow eff a c
  First :: FreeArrow eff a b -> FreeArrow (a,c) (b,c)
```

#### Final ~~countdown~~ encoding

```haskell
type FreeArrow eff a b =
  forall ar. (Arrow ar) => (forall x y. eff x y -> ar x y) -> ar a b
```

---

# Summary

- Kleisli (used in `funflow`)
- Cokleisli
- Tannen (used in `porcupine`)
- Product (to be used in `porcupine`)
- Alternation
- Free arrows (used in `funflow`)

### Do these cover all the ways to define an arrow?

Let's say that's left as an exercise to the reader :) (Pheeewww...)

### What about that "profunctor" cr*p I hear about?

`Arrow` = `Category` ∩ `Profunctor` ∩ `Strong` ∩ `arr` method

but these aren't all in `base` for now.

---

# What was the point?

```haskell
newtype ArrowFromEffects f w m a b =
    ArrowFromEffects (f (w a -> m b))
```

An arrow is the combination of monadic, comonadic and applicative
effects, or some parallel/sequential combination of that, itself possibly
wrapped in an applicative. Pretty general a framework.

_**Arrow = computation with ahead-of-time effects (applicative) and just-in-time
effects (monadic)**_

Defining applicative and monadic effects easy: lots of them around, lots of libraries.

Decomposing applicative effects as separate types (to `Compose` them) clean and
easy.

Use of comonadic effects? ...Could come handy. Dunno, still processing, some
papers to read and all.


### IMHO: Very relevant for code decomposition and reusability

---

# Comparison with Applicative

_In case of no monadic effects_, one could argue that:

```haskell
type Arr a b = f (a -> b)
```

Same power? Do we _really_ need arrows? (= Couldn't we have an equivalent for
every class this way?)

### Let's try to implement the Arrow stack with that type:

```haskell
class Category    -- Yup
class Arrow       -- Yup
class ArrowZero   -- Alternative is there, so yup
class ArrowPlus   -- Yup, for same reasons
class ArrowLoop   -- Oh, oh, wait, wait, is it... and yes that's a yup
class ArrowChoice -- Yes... Aaaand dammit, no, it doesn't have the right semantics
class ArrowApply  -- Lol
```

`ArrowChoice` doesn't have the right semantics (though it satisfies Arrow
laws!): you can't shortcut effects.

---

# Comparison with Applicative (2)

### Wait! Now we have `Selective`!!

...Yeah. Still no ArrowChoice, sorry...

```haskell
branch :: (Selective f)
       => f (a -> c) -> f (b -> d) -> f (Etiher a b) -> f (Either c d)
(|||)  :: (ArrowChoice arr)
       => arr a c    -> arr b d    -> arr (Either a b)    (Either c d)
```

If `arr` is `f (a -> b)` that gives:

```haskell
branch :: f (a -> c) -> f (b -> d) -> f (Etiher a b) -> f (Either c d)
(|||)  :: f (a -> c) -> f (b -> d) -> f (Either a b -> Either c d)
```

`(|||)` with `(<*>)` gives you `branch`, but no way back possible.

#### Every `ArrowChoice` can give you a `Selective`, but not the reverse :/

---

# Case of `funflow`

One of most important functions:
	
```haskell
step' :: Properties a b -> (a -> b) -> Flow a b
```	

Generalization of `arr` function

Could have been:

```haskell
step' :: Properties a b -> (a -> b) -> AppFlow (a -> b)
```

(thus generalizing `pure`)	

But what about:

```haskell
stepIO' :: Properties a b -> (a -> IO b) -> Flow a b
```

No way to return a `f (a -> b)` from a `(a -> m b)`!!
